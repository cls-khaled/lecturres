css :
  - position :
    - "static" 
    - "stiky" 
  - position relationship (concept):
    - "An element with position: absolute; is positioned relative to the nearest positioned ancestor (instead of positioned relative to the viewport, like fixed).
      However; if an absolute positioned element has no positioned ancestors, it uses the document body, and moves along with page scrolling.
      Note: Absolute positioned elements are removed from the normal flow, and can overlap elements."
  - over-flow : effect all tags 
  - css children selector : first-child, last-child, nth-child  
  - ::scrollbar : 
    - "css selector for scrollbar"
    - ::~button
    - ::~thumb
    - ::~track
